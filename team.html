                                <p>Dr. Jason Palm graduated from Louisiana State University Veterinary School in 1999. He has been working at Hiawassee since 2002 and has been an owner since 2003. Dr. Palm tries to give your pet the individual attention
                                    he or she deserves. He will patiently review all options for the care of your pet with you. His special veterinary interests include diseases of senior patients, pain management, and the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
                                    Dr. Palm's hobbies are writing and recording music in his studio at home, gardening with native plants, fitness, and taking nature photos (all the photos hanging in the clinic are his). He has traveled extensively in
                                    the United States, Europe, and Mexico.

                                    administrative, medical, or mechanical. You may see me at the front desk, in the hallways, or not at all ... whatever the day brings me. Outside of work I enjoy time with my husband and son, sometimes get to cook or
                                    bake, and may even find time for my garden.

                                & and enjoying every moment at my job. When I am not at HVC, I am on stage performing downtown at Stardust Lounge where my creativity & crazy silly personality emerges. My motto is "why go through life unnoticed." One interesting

                                    People that know me call me “Dr. Dolittle” because of my passion and love for animals. I love my job and I come to work every day thankful for what I do. At this point in my life, I have decided to go back to school
                                    and become a veterinarian so that I can continue working with the animals that I love. One other fun fact about me is that I am a bit of a geek I love to read (anything sci-fi or fantasy), and I am a big Harry Potter
                                    nerd (yes I have the wand and everything). Now that you have read this come in say hi and have a magical day.

                            <p>Hey everyone, my name is Juan Perez, and I have been working for HVC since August 2010, but I’ve been working in this field since 2002. I’m originally from the Bronx, N.Y. and that’s where I learned a lot about animals and
                                the field itself. I also love to draw and have started my own little project in the boarding facility here. I have a very strong passion and respect for pit bulls; this is why I own three. My goal is to run a pit bull rescue
                                so I can help this misunderstood breed. I come to work every day with a positive attitude because, although I’m not a veterinarian, I feel as if I make life a little better for the animals in general. I love this job and
                                work very hard at it because working in this field has made me respect the little things about animals that a lot of people don’t notice. I want to further my knowledge of animals so that one day I can become a veterinarian.</p>

                                    Dr. Palm. I love what I do for a living for two reasons. One I am an animal lover (but who here isn’t) and two, I enjoy helping people. I am the proud mother of two wonderful boys, Troy my oldest and Jeremiah my youngest.
                                    They are the world to me, and the reason I get up every morning. Besides them I also love anything with butterflies, working out, and cooking. That’s just a bit about me and I do look forward to meeting you.

                                in my life since I was a young child, and I have always wanted to help them be free of pain and fear. I’m currently a senior in high school. I am also working towards becoming a Certified Veterinary Assistant. Outside of
